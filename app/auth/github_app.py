"""GitHub App (bot) identity — the second, privileged identity (scaffolding-plan §3).

Two identities, deliberately:

- **Per-user OAuth** (``github_oauth``) opens the branch / PR *as the submitter*, so authorship
  is real and attributed.
- **GitHub App** (this module) performs the privileged, cross-cutting actions the user token
  must not: merging on curator approval and posting the read-only PR-preview *mirror* comment.
  A stable bot identity is also what future webhooks (PR opened/closed → expire locks, issue #8)
  authenticate against.

Authenticating as the App is two-legged: sign a short-lived RS256 JWT with the App's private
key (proves "I am this App"), exchange it for a per-installation access token (valid ~1h, proves
"I am this App *on this repo*"), and cache that token until shortly before it expires so we don't
mint a new one on every call.
