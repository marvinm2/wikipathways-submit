"""How a review's state is named on screen.

One vocabulary for the badge, the queue tab, the card banner and the empty state. Without it the
dashboard prints the stored enum — a curator reads ``changes_requested`` and ``publish_failed``,
underscores and all, and the four states the pipeline actually spends its time in have no tab to
reach them from.

The long-form sentences used in the mirror comment live in ``app.review.service._PLAIN_STATUS``
and say the same things in prose; these are the short forms.
