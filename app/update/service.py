"""Update-an-existing-pathway flow.

    check out (lock) → validate revision → branch off *latest* main → commit → open PR

Three design guarantees converge here:

- **One editor at a time (§4.3).** Acquiring the pathway lock is step one; if someone else holds
  it, or an open GitHub PR already touches the pathway (the injected ``open_pr_scanner`` on the
  registry), the update is refused. This is what makes the #90 unmergeable-conflict impossible.
- **Branch off the latest main (§5).** The revision branch is always cut from the current base
  head, so a merged PR never leaves this one rebasing across a GPML (XML) conflict.
- **The lock is held until the PR resolves.** On success the PR number is attached to the lock;
  the lock is released by webhook on PR close/merge, or by TTL. On *failure* the lock is released
  immediately so a broken attempt never freezes the pathway.
