"""Engine / session construction.

The registry must be transactional (atomic WPID reservation, lock acquisition). PostgreSQL is
the production target; SQLite is fine for dev and tests. For SQLite we enable WAL + a busy
timeout so concurrent writers serialize with a wait rather than failing instantly — the
allocator's insert-retry loop still handles the rare genuine conflict.
