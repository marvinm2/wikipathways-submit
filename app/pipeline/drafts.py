"""Read the derived artifacts the target repo's own PR pipeline publishes.

`wikipathways/sandbox-wp-db`'s workflow 1 does not leave its output on the pull request. It
pushes a rendered draft into the *sister* site repo `wikipathways/sandbox-wp.gh.io`, filed under
a slug built from the PR number — `WP0__PR54` for a new pathway, `WP<id>__PR54` for an edit —
and links the resulting draft page from the PR description. Those files are the only rendered
view of a submission the pipeline produces, so the dashboard reads them to fill its preview slot
and to pre-fill the curation checklist from what the pipeline itself extracted.

Read anonymously over raw.githubusercontent.com, deliberately, and *not* through
`app.github.client`: that abstraction is about the target repo and its two authenticated
identities, and the GitHub App is installed on sandbox-wp-db only, so an installation token 404s
on the site repo. The files are public and a few kB each, so an unauthenticated GET is both
sufficient and simpler than arranging a second installation.

Everything here degrades quietly, because a draft is missing more often than not. Of the last 20
runs of `1_on_pull_request.yml` (measured 2026-07-27 with `gh run list`): 5 succeeded, 14 failed,
1 was cancelled. Twelve of the fourteen failures were in the `metadata` job, one in `get-gpml`
and one in `frontmatter`. So `fetch` never raises, and the check functions return None when they
have nothing to say, leaving the checklist whatever the app already derived from the GPML itself.
