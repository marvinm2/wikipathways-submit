"""Where a submission's branch lives, and whose credentials put it there.

Three arrangements, and the difference between them is one repository name:

- **user** — the submitter pushes a branch to the content repo with their own token. The app's
  default, and correct wherever the submitter has write access: their own fork, the demo.
- **bot** — the GitHub App pushes the branch instead, because an ordinary contributor has no
  write access to a shared content repo. Authorship survives on the commit, but the *pull
  request* is the bot's: the bot is who GitHub notifies, who can edit the description, and who
  closes it. Every submission appears to come from one account.
- **fork** — the submitter's own fork holds the branch and the pull request is cross-repository,
  which is how contributing to a repo you cannot write to normally works. 36 of the last 53 pull
  requests on the content repo are already this shape, so it is the *ordinary* mode there and the
  bot-pushes-a-branch model is the unusual one (issue #22).

Fork mode asks nothing new of the submitter. The app already holds their OAuth token and already
requests ``public_repo``, which GitHub defines as read/write to code on public repositories —
that covers creating a fork of one and pushing to it. So this exercises capability the app has
rather than acquiring any, which is what makes it a smaller change than it first looks.

        **The branch repository, which in fork mode is the submitter's fork, not the content
        repo.** This reverses what the app did until 2026-08-05, and the reason is not a
        preference: GitHub refuses to point a ref at a commit the repository does not itself hold.
        A commit merely readable through the shared fork network answers **404** — as distinct
        from 422 ``Object does not exist`` for a commit outside the network, and 201 for the
        repository's own. So cutting a fork's branch from the *content* repo's head is only
        possible while the fork happens to be level with it, which is true for a few minutes after
        the fork is created and false ever after. That is the whole of issue #29, and it presented
        as a permission problem for a day because 404 is also what GitHub says to a write you may
        not make.

        The fork's own head is native by definition, so this works on any topology and needs no
        sync to have succeeded first. ``ensure_fork`` still fast-forwards where it can, which keeps
        the base recent; this makes the write possible when it could not.

        A stale base is safe here in a way it would not be in a normal codebase, and that is a
        property of *this* repository rather than a general one: GPML is never line-merged and
        derived files are regenerated, so the uploaded file replaces its predecessor wholesale
        rather than being reconciled against it. GitHub computes the pull request's diff against
        the merge base, so an old base does not drag unrelated files into the change. What a stale
        base cannot protect against is two people editing one pathway, and that is what the
        check-out lock is for.

    different partial state, and reconciling that is a new class of bug in exchange for a case
