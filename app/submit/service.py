"""New-pathway submission service (design §4.1).

Orchestrates the new-pathway flow end to end:

    validate GPML → reserve WPID (atomic) → write WPID into the GPML → create a branch →
    commit the file → open a PR → record the PR number on the reservation.

Two correctness properties:

- **A failed submission burns no WPID.** If any GitHub step fails after the WPID was reserved,
  the reservation is released (id returned to the pool) before the error propagates. (Reservations
  also expire by TTL, but immediate release keeps the sequence tight.)
- **Validation happens before allocation**, so a malformed upload never consumes an id at all.
