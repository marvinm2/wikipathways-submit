"""The vocabulary every quality check in this app speaks.

Before this there were three, and they disagreed. ``app.submit.gpml.validate_gpml`` had two
outcomes (raise, or return); ``app.review.checklist`` had four states; ``mvp1/validate_pathway.py``
had three severities and a worst-wins rollup. The target repository's own ``testing`` job has a
fourth vocabulary again ("PASS" / "REVIEW REQUIRED"). A submitter could pass the first, be warned
by the second, and be sent back by the third, with nothing tying the three answers together.

The severities here are ``mvp1``'s three, plus the two it does not need:

- ``na`` — the rule had no subject. No references to count, no base version to diff against.
  Ranked *below* ``pass`` so it can never win a rollup: "there was nothing to check" is not a
  quality signal, and letting it rank as a pass would report an empty pathway as all-green.
- ``block`` — the submission is refused outright. This is the one distinction ``mvp1`` can do
  without and this module cannot: ``mvp1`` runs after the fact on a file already in the
  repository, so its worst verdict is still only a report. Here, four of the rules decide an
  HTTP 422. Collapsing ``block`` into ``fail`` would either start refusing submissions the portal
  accepts today (a pathway with no data nodes) or stop refusing ones it must (no Organism).
