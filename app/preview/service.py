"""Pathway preview service (issue #11) — the before/after render the dashboard shows.

The app draws both sides itself (``app/preview/render.py``) when the PR is created and caches the
SVGs on disk, so a curator sees the diagram immediately with no CI wait.

There is no second source. CI used to render with PinPath and upload the SVGs as a run artifact,
and this service downloaded them; that path was retired on 2026-07-27 along with the render step
itself (``mvp1/pr-preview.yml`` now converts to pvjson only — a PR comment cannot show an image
anyway). What CI produces is validation, not pictures, so nothing here talks to GitHub.

Cached per PR under ``<cache_dir>/<pr_number>/``: ``before.svg`` / ``after.svg``, the
``metadata.json`` sidecar the dashboard panel reads, and a ``render-failed`` marker when a GPML
could not be drawn (so the queue can say so instead of spinning on "generating" forever).
