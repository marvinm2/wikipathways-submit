"""What changed between an update's before and after renders (issue #24).

The before/after viewer (issue #11) made the change *visible* and left working out *what* changed
to the curator's eye, across two images that can be a hundred nodes each. This closes the last
open part of the audit's problem #1 ("reviewers approve unreadable XML"): it is a comparison of
two lists the app already has on disk, not new extraction, because ``render_gpml_with_nodes``
returns each data node's identity, annotation and position in the same pass that draws it.

The categories, in the order a curator cares about them:

- **reannotated** — the same node, a different database or identifier. The most review-relevant
  and the least visible in a picture, because the box looks identical.
- **added** / **removed** — in one side and not the other.
- **relabelled** — the same annotation under a different name.
- **moved** — same node, different place. Usually noise, which is why the overlay can hide it.

Nothing here is a substitute for reading the GPML when it matters; it is a summary that tells a
curator whether they need to.
