"""The quality ruleset, run against pathways the project has actually published.

Every fixture elsewhere in this suite is hand-written, which means it encodes what its author
already knew to include — so it can confirm the rules they thought of and nothing else. That has
now cost real time five separate times (see `tests/fixtures/published/README.md`), always the same
shape: a GPML the portal renders and validates happily that the content repository's own reader
refuses, or that is missing something the repository asks for.

These two files are the negative control. They are PathVisio output that survived curation and
publication, so a rule reporting `fail` or `block` on one of them is wrong about reality whatever
it says about the schema.

#: softened to fit. None of them is a prediction that the pipeline breaks.

#: - ``content.datanode_annotation`` — 21 of 30 sampled pathways have at least one unannotated
#:   data node. Genuinely common, and genuinely worth a curator's attention on a *new* submission.
#: - ``content.references`` — 6 of 30 declare no literature reference at all. The repository's own
#:   reviewer checklist asks for one, so warning is honest even though a fifth of published
#:   content would trip it (issue #27).
#: - ``gpml.citation_ids`` — empty ``<bp:ID>`` elements, which the repository rewrites to ``NA``
#:   before running. A warning about the source file, by design.
#: - ``content.description`` / ``content.title_length`` — the repository's own thresholds, ported.
#:   Legacy content predates them.
